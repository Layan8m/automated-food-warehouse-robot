# automated-food-warehouse-robot
A smart robotic system for fully automating food warehouse storage and handling without human intervention

## üß† Algorithm

1. System startup  
2. Scan warehouse and check equipment readiness  
3. Receive food items (via sensors or camera)  
4. Identify the type of item  
5. Determine appropriate storage location  
6. Activate robotic arm to pick item  
7. Place item in correct location  
8. Update storage database  
9. Return to standby mode  
10. Repeat until all items are processed  
11. Shut down system
